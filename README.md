# hello-world
this is my first repository!

I am a sophomore Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology. I know how to use Java and Python reasonably well, and over summer break I used FreeCodeCamp to teach myself html/css, JavaScript and React + Redux, and am currently learning how to use GitHub in order to continue my path in Computer Science. Most of the content on my GitHub page in the near future is going to be website oriented, and so I think its important to mention that although I think graphic/web design is pretty fun, I dont want to nail it down as the field of work I want to pursue just yet, and keep it as a creative outlet for now.

 ### Some of my hobbies:
- Learning how to use new coding languages and other creative tools
- Folding advanced origami models and tesselations (see [@gsamsa1099](https://www.instagram.com/gsamsa1099/) on instagram)
- Competing as a starter for my college's D3 fencing team
- Playing badminton with my friends and at my college's badminton club
- Listening to music - I generally listen to at least one new album a day
- Taking long walks and exploring scenic areas around my hometown and college
- Collecting posters and art prints to hang up in my room/dorm
- Every once in a while I open up mspaint to doodle

### My computer science roadmap
- [x] Earn Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, and Front End Development Libraries certifications from FCC[^1]
- [x] Familiarize myself with GitHub
- [ ] Code the front end of some of my simpler project ideas from my project idea backlog
- [ ] Code the front end of my portfolio website
- [ ] Earn my Back End Development and APIs certification from FCC
- [ ] Set up the back end of my website and projects
- [ ] Build and deploy my portfolio website, showcase my previously coded projects
- [ ] Learn c++ (If I haven't learned it already through school)
- [ ] Build some of my more ambitious projects and launch them as applications
- [ ] Complete FCC's Project Euler challenge set (maybe earlier?)
- [ ] Learn how to use matlab (maybe?)
